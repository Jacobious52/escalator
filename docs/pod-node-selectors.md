# Pod and Node Selectors

For pods and nodes to be considered in the calculations for a node group, they must be appropriately labelled.
Escalator uses the configured label and label value in the `nodegroups_config.yaml` file for this.

## Nodes

Nodes are selected if they have a label matching the `label_key` and value matching the `label_value` in the 
`nodegroups_config.yaml` file.

You can see which nodes Escalator will monitor with the following `kubectl` command:

`kubectl get nodes --selector=customer=shared`

You can see the function that performs the filtering of nodes in the 
[`pkg/controller/node_group.go` file](../pkg/controller/node_group.go), specifically `NewNodeLabelFilterFunc()`.

## Pods

Selecting pods is a little more complex, as it considers the pod's nodeSelector, as well as the pod's nodeAffinity.

The following pod node selector will include the pod in the `customer=shared` node group:

```yaml
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    customer: shared
```

The following pod node affinity will include the pod in the `customer=shared` node group:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: customer
            operator: In
            values:
            - shared
```

Replace `customer` and `shared` with your node/pod label key-value.

You can see the function that performs the filtering of pods in the 
[`pkg/controller/node_group.go` file](../pkg/controller/node_group.go), specifically `NewPodAffinityFilterFunc()`.

## Default Pod Selector

Escalator includes an option to include pods into the utilisation calculations for pods that don't have a `nodeSelector`
or a `nodeAffinity` specified. This is useful when running a "shared" node group that picks up any pods that don't run
on a specific node. 

It also filters out DaemonSet pods and Static pods from the calculations as it may pick up ones that are not running in
the shared node group.

When this option is used, a different pod filtering method is utilised:

```go
// allow pods without a node selector and without a pod affinity
return len(pod.Spec.NodeSelector) == 0 && pod.Spec.Affinity == nil
```

To use this option, name the node group `default` in the `nodegroups_config.yaml` file like so:

```yaml
node_groups:
  - name: "default"
    label_key: "customer"
    label_value: "shared"
``` 

`label_key` and `label_value` is still used for selecting which nodes are included in the capacity calculations.
